    """Solve approximately the TSP using a 2-opt approach.

    A sub-optimal solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
    is provided using the 2-opt approach in O(nÂ²) time and memory,
    where chunks of  an arbitrary initial route are reversed,
    and selected if the total distance is reduced. A notable
    result in 2D is that the path is guaranteed to never cross
    itself.

    This implementation solves the TSP for a one-way path, not a
    looping cycle.

    Parameters
    ----------
    locations : NDArray
        An array of N points with shape (N, D) where D is the space dimension.
    improvement_threshold : float, optional
        Threshold used as progress criterion to stop the optimization process.
        The default is 1e-8.

    Returns
    -------
    NDArray
        The new positions order of shape (N,).
