    """Solve the TSP problem using a 2-opt approach.

    A sub-optimal solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
    is provided using the 2-opt approach in O(nÂ²) where chunks of
    an initially random route are reversed, and selected if the
    total distance is reduced. As a result, the route solution
    does not cross its own path in 2D.

    Parameters
    ----------
    locations : NDArray
        An array of N points with shape (N, D) where D is the space dimension.
    improvement_threshold : float, optional
        Threshold used as progress criterion to stop the optimization process.
        The default is 1e-8.

    Returns
    -------
    NDArray
        The new positions order of shape (N,).
