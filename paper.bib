  abstract = {Nonuniform fast Fourier transforms dominate the computational cost in many applications including image reconstruction and signal processing. We thus present a generalpurpose GPU-based CUDA library for type 1 (nonuniform to uniform) and type 2 (uniform to nonuniform) transforms in dimensions 2 and 3, in single or double precision. It achieves high performance for a given user-requested accuracy, regardless of the distribution of nonuniform points, via cache-aware point reordering, and load-balanced blocked spreading in shared memory. At low accuracies, this gives on-GPU throughputs around 109 nonuniform points per second, and (even including hostdevice transfer) is typically 4–10× faster than the latest parallel CPU code FINUFFT (at 28 threads). It is competitive with two established GPU codes, being up to 90× faster at high accuracy and/or type 1 clustered point distributions. Finally we demonstrate a 5–12× speedup versus CPU in an X-ray diffraction 3D iterative reconstruction task at 10−12 accuracy, observing excellent multi-GPU weak scaling up to one rank per GPU.},

  abstract = {In magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic field inhomogeneities cause distortions in images that are reconstructed by conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods. Several noniterative image reconstruction methods are used currently to compensate for field inhomogeneities, but these methods assume that the field map that characterizes the off-resonance frequencies is spatially smooth. Recently, iterative methods have been proposed that can circumvent this assumption and provide improved compensation for off-resonance effects. However, straightforward implementations of such iterative methods suffer from inconveniently long computation times. This paper describes a tool for accelerating iterative reconstruction of field-corrected MR images: a novel time-segmented approximation to the MR signal equation. We use a min-max formulation to derive the temporal interpolator. Speedups of around 60 were achieved by combining this temporal interpolator with a nonuniform fast Fourier transform with normalized root mean squared approximation errors of 0.07\%. The proposed method provides fast, accurate, field-corrected image reconstruction even when the field map is not smooth.},

  abstract = {The FFT is used widely in signal processing for efficient computation of the Fourier transform (FT) of finitelength signals over a set of uniformly-spaced frequency locations. However, in many applications, one requires nonuniform sampling in the frequency domain, i.e., a nonuniform FT. Several papers have described fast approximations for the nonuniform FT based on interpolating an oversampled FFT. This paper presents an interpolation method for the nonuniform FT that is optimal in the min-max sense of minimizing the worst-case approximation error over all signals of unit norm. The proposed method easily generalizes to multidimensional signals. Numerical results show that the min-max approach provides substantially lower approximation errors than conventional interpolation methods. The min-max criterion is also useful for optimizing the parameters of interpolation kernels such as the Kaiser-Bessel function.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest in learning k-space sampling patterns for MRI using optimization approaches [1], [2], [3], [4]. For non-Cartesian sampling patterns, reconstruction methods typically involve non-uniform FFT (NUFFT) operations. A typical NUFFT method contains frequency domain interpolation using Kaiser-Bessel kernel values that are retrieved by nearest neighbor look-up in a finely tabulated kernel [5]. That look-up operation is not differentiable with respect to the sampling pattern, complicating auto-differentiation routines for backpropagation (stochastic gradient descent) for sampling pattern optimization. This paper describes an efficient and accurate approach for computing approximate gradients with respect to the sampling pattern for learning k-space sampling. Various numerical experiments validate the accuracy of the proposed approximation. We also showcase the trajectories optimized for different iterative reconstruction algorithms, including smooth convex regularized reconstruction and compressed sensing-based reconstruction.},
