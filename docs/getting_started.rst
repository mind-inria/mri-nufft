Getting Started
===============

Installing MRI-NUFFT
--------------------

mri-nufft is available on PyPi

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install mri-nufft

Development Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to modifiy the mri-nufft code base

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com:mind-inria/mri-nufft
    pip install -e ./mri-nufft[dev]


Choosing a NUFFT Backend
========================

In order to perform Non-Uniform fast Fourier transform you need to install a specific backend library.

Supported Libraries
-------------------

These libraries need to be installed separately from this package.

.. Don't touch the spacing ! ..

- (*) stacked-nufft allows one to use any supported backend to perform a stack of 2D NUFFT and adds a z-axis FFT (using scipy or cupy)


**The NUFFT operation is often not enough to provide decent image quality by itself (even with density compensation)**.
For improved image quality, use a Compressed Sensing recon. For doing so, you can check the pysap-mri_ for MRI dedicated solutions and deepinv_ for Deep Learning based solutions.

Backend Installations
---------------------

To benefit the most from certain backends we recommend to use the following instructions

finufft / cufinufft
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Those are developed by the `flatiron-institute <https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft>`_ and are installable with `pip install finufft` and `pip install cufinufft`.

.. warning::

    for cufinufft, a working installation of CUDA and cupy is required.

gpuNUFFT
~~~~~~~~

an active gpuNUFFT fork is maintained by `chaithyagr <https://github.com/chaithyagr/gpunufft/>`_.

.. warning::

    This is compatible only up to CUDA 11.8 !

To install it use `pip install gpuNUFFT` or for local development.

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/chaythiagr/gpuNUFFT
    cd gpuNUFFT
    python setup.py install

BART
~~~~

BART has to be installed separately and `bart` command needs to be runnable from your `PATH`.
See `installation instructions <https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/installation.html>`_


PyNFFT
~~~~~~

PyNFFT requires Cython<3.0.0 to work.  and can be installed using

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install cython<3.0.0 pynfft2

Which backend to use
--------------------
[TBA] See the benchmark. Fastest are gpunufft and cufinufft (because they are using gpu). Additionally, Gunufft is usually more memory efficient.


.. note::
   if you are using pytorch gpu-array, you can only use cufinufft.
