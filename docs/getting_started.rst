Welcome to MRI-NUFFT ! This library provides efficient implementations of Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT) algorithms specifically designed for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) applications.

Whether you are a researcher, developer, or student, this guide will help you get started with installing and using MRI-NUFFT for your MRI data processing needs.

Installation
------------

To install MRI-NUFFT, follow the instructions in the :doc:`install` section. This guide covers the prerequisites, installation steps, and verification of the installation.

Using MRI-NUFFT
-----------------

Once you have installed MRI-NUFFT, you can start using it in your projects. The :doc:`backend` section provides more details on how to perform NUFFT operation with a specific library backend, and :ref:`mri-nufft-interface` describes the main interface of the NUFFT operator you can use in your application.

.. note::

   We also provide a large collection of :ref:`trajectories <trajectories_examples>` and some :py:mod:`extras capabilities <mrinufft.extras>` for doing non-Cartesian MRI processing.



What's Next?
------------

- You can explore the :ref:`general_examples` section to see practical applications of MRI-NUFFT, or refer to the :doc:`api` for detailed information on the available functions and classes.

- If you want to learn more about the underlying concepts of NUFFT and its applications in MRI, check out the :doc:`explanations/index` section.

- Maybe you are also interested in the  :doc:`misc/related`.
